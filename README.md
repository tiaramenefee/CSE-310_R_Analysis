# Overview

I developed a program in R to perform a linear regression analysis on my Cowboy database. This project focuses on investigating whether there is a correlation between passing attempts and total passing yards for quarterback Dak Prescott.

The goal of this project was to strengthen my understanding of R syntax, data manipulation, and statistical modeling, while applying these concepts to a real-world dataset I created earlier. By integrating my previously built database with Râ€™s analytical capabilities, I was able to visualize trends, evaluate model accuracy, and gain insights into player performance using regression technique


{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}

The tools that I used were my previous database from SQLlite, Visual Code, and R Studio.

{Describe the programming language that you used and any libraries.}

The Language that was used for this program was SQL and R. For libraries, I used DBI, RSqlite and ggplot3.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Add more data to my database so that I could get more of an accurate model
- Look more into if the rushing performance by running backs affected Dak performance.
- Improve graph I creaded amd make it better visually. It looks kinda of bare and basic.
